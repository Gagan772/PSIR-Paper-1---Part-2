- Than Governors in states
- Given Union Territories' special constitutional status
- Governors: Bridge between state and central governments
- LGs in UTs like Delhi: More pronounced governance role
- Union's direct interest, coordination on national importance matters

*"The LG versus Governor power question has no simple answer—it's comparing Delhi's apple to states' oranges. The LG's 'more pronounced' role reflects not greater power but different architecture: UTs are Union's stepchildren, needing tighter federal embrace than states' autonomy allows. The 2018 Supreme Court judgment tried to balance this unique constitutional position, but Delhi's governance tensions prove that constitutional text and political practice remain works in progress."*

*"The Supreme Court's metamorphosis into a policy evolution forum is constitutional pragmatism meeting legislative lethargy—when Parliament sleeps on sexual harassment, the Court delivers Vishaka; when executive dithers on environment, MC Mehta directives clear Delhi's air. Yet this judicial entrepreneurship walks a tightrope: one step too far and democracy's elected branches lose their primacy. The Court must remain policy's catalyst, not its author, ensuring that judicial activism serves democracy rather than substituting for it."*

The 99th Amendment (2014) established National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) to replace Collegium system for judicial appointments—aimed at transparency with six-member body including CJI, judges, Law Minister, eminent persons; struck down by Supreme Court (2015) in Advocates-on-Record Association case as unconstitutional for compromising judicial independence and altering basic structure; reaffirmed Collegium, highlighting tension between transparency and independence.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
99th Amendment 2014 | NJAC | National Judicial Appointments Commission | Collegium System | CJI Chairperson | Law Minister | Eminent Persons | Ravi Shankar Prasad | Transparency | Accountability | Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association 2015 | Judicial Independence | Separation of Powers | Basic Structure | Unconstitutional

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Enacted through Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014
- Marked significant alteration in judicial appointment process
- Higher judiciary: Supreme Court and High Courts
- Led to establishment of NJAC
- Body designed to replace collegium system
- Aimed for more transparent and collaborative mechanism
- Involving both judiciary and executive

**Body:**

*NJAC Composition:*
- Consisted of six members
- Chief Justice of India as Chairperson
- Two other senior judges next to CJI

- Challenged in Supreme Court
- Critics including senior jurists and judges
- Contended NJAC infringed upon judicial independence
- Cornerstone of Indian democracy
- Separation of powers principle enshrined in Constitution
- Including executive members could allow undue government influence

*Supreme Court Judgment (2015):*
- Landmark judgment in Advocates-on-Record Association vs. Union of India
- Declared both 99th Amendment and NJAC Act unconstitutional
- Effectively nullifying NJAC
- Reasoned: Amendment and Act compromised judicial independence
- Altered basic structure of Constitution
- Verdict reaffirmed collegium system
- Emphasizing need to preserve judicial independence from executive

*Ongoing Debate:*
- Controversy underscores delicate balance
- Between judicial independence and transparency/accountability need
- Amendment intended to reform appointments process

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"The 99th Amendment's rise and fall is a constitutional cautionary tale—Parliament's democratic impulse to reform judicial appointments collided with the Supreme Court's independence imperative, and the latter prevailed. The NJAC's obituary teaches that in the judicial domain, good intentions don't override constitutional architecture. India still awaits a Goldilocks solution: not too opaque like the Collegium, not too executive-influenced like the NJAC, but just right—transparent yet independent."*

## Q.19) Differentiate parliamentary supremacy from parliamentary sovereignty. Would you consider the Indian Parliament as a Sovereign Parliament? Examine. (2017) (20)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Parliamentary supremacy (legislature's final decisions, UK model per A.V. Dicey) differs from parliamentary sovereignty (absolute unlimited power); Indian Parliament operates under parliamentary supremacy NOT sovereignty—bound by constitutional limitations (basic structure doctrine from Kesavananda Bharati 1973), judicial review, federal structure limiting legislative domain; ensuring accountability and rule of law through checks and balances.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
Parliamentary Supremacy | Parliamentary Sovereignty | UK Legal System | A.V. Dicey | British Constitution | Indian Parliament | Constitutional Limitations | Basic Structure Doctrine | Kesavananda Bharati 1973 | Judicial Review | Federal Structure | Union List | Concurrent List | State List | Separation of Powers | Checks and Balances | Rule of Law

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Concepts central to understanding legislative power nature and limits
- Within different political systems
- Often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings
- Delineate extent of legislative authority

**Body:**

*Parliamentary Supremacy Definition:*
- System where legislature's decisions are final
- Cannot be overridden
- Traditionally associated with UK's legal system
- Acts of Parliament are highest form of law
- No other body, including judiciary, can question validity
- A.V. Dicey's interpretation of British Constitution
- Parliament has right to make or repeal any law
- No person or body recognized as having right to override
- Or set aside Parliament legislation

*Parliamentary Sovereignty Definition:*
- Broader concept where legislature has supreme legislative authority
- Stands as highest source of authority in state
- Encompasses absolute and unlimited power
- Free from external constraints
- Including international laws or constitutional provisions

*Indian Parliament Examination:*
- Framework established by Constitution
- Federal structure with clear separation of powers
- Among legislature, executive, judiciary
- Distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and state legislatures
- Indian Parliament does NOT enjoy absolute sovereignty

*Constitutional Limitations:*
- Parliament operates within Constitution constraints
- Laws can be challenged in courts on constitutional violation grounds
- Basic structure doctrine (Kesavananda Bharati 1973)
- Parliament cannot amend Constitution altering fundamental framework
- Places clear limit on parliamentary authority

*Judicial Review:*
- Judiciary has power to review Parliament-passed laws
- Strike down if found unconstitutional
- System of checks and balances ensures parliamentary legislation
- Adheres to constitutional mandates and principles

*Federal Structure Limitations:*
- Distribution of powers between Union and states
- Restricts Parliament's legislative authority
- Union List and Concurrent List subjects
- State legislatures have exclusive power over State List
- Further limiting Parliament's legislative domain

**Conclusion:**
Indian Parliament does not embody parliamentary sovereignty in purest form as seen in UK; instead reflects model of parliamentary supremacy wherein Parliament is supreme legislative body but operates within constitutional bounds; subject to judicial review; presence of constitutional constraints and checks/balances system underscores nuanced distinction between supremacy and sovereignty in Indian context; structured framework ensures while Parliament enjoys predominant position in legislative process, powers not absolute, reinforcing democratic principles of accountability and rule of law.

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"India consciously chose parliamentary supremacy over sovereignty—a choice that defines our constitutional character. Unlike Britain's Parliament that can theoretically abolish itself, Indian Parliament lives within the Constitution's guardrails: Kesavananda's basic structure, judicial review's sword, and federalism's distributed authority. This 'limited supremacy' isn't weakness but wisdom, ensuring that today's legislative majority cannot, in Ambedkar's nightmare, create tomorrow's tyranny by amending away democracy itself."*

## Q.21) Judiciary has acquired the role of both, a legislature and an executive in recent years. Examine with suitable examples. (2017) (20)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Judiciary assumed quasi-legislative functions (Vishaka Guidelines 1997 for sexual harassment pre-legislation) and executive roles (MC Mehta environmental directives monitoring implementation, appointing oversight committees)—judicial activism through PIL fills legislative gaps and ensures executive accountability; praised by Upendra Baxi for human rights advancement, criticized by Arun Shourie for disrupting constitutional balance of power and separation of powers principle.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
Judicial Activism | Public Interest Litigation | PIL | Quasi-Legislative Function | Quasi-Executive Role | Vishaka Guidelines 1997 | Sexual Harassment Act 2013 | Upendra Baxi | MC Mehta vs. Union of India | Taj Mahal Protection | Environmental Directives | Monitoring Committees | Arun Shourie | Separation of Powers | Constitutional Balance | Legislative Gaps | Executive Accountability

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Judiciary increasingly taken on roles traditionally associated with legislature and executive
- Development sparked considerable debate regarding separation of powers
- As enshrined in Constitution
- Phenomenon encapsulated under "judicial activism" and "PIL"
- Courts stepping in to fill legislative gaps
- Or ensure executive accountability
- Especially perceived inaction or inadequacy addressing public welfare

**Body:**

*Quasi-Legislative Function - Vishaka Guidelines:*
- Illustrative example of judiciary performing quasi-legislative function
- Supreme Court in 1997
- Absence of specific law preventing workplace sexual harassment
- Guidelines stood as law until Act enacted in 2013
- Upendra Baxi: Lauds advancing human rights
- Where legislative body slow to act
- Critics argue: Represents judiciary overreach into legislative domain
- Constitutionally tasked with law-making

*Quasi-Executive Role - MC Mehta Environmental Case:*
- Judiciary assumed roles reserved for executive
- Notable in environmental and public health interventions
- MC Mehta v. Union of India
- Supreme Court's directives relocating industries
- Protecting Taj Mahal from pollution
- Involved detailed administrative planning
- Function typically within executive's ambit
- Court monitored implementation of orders
- Sometimes appointing committees to oversee compliance
- Effectively taking on executive functions
- Ensuring directives followed

*Criticism of Judicial Interventions:*
- Not without detractors
- Critics including political figures, commentators like Arun Shourie
- Argue: Such interventions disrupt balance of power
- Between government branches
- Judiciary encroaching on legislature and executive functions/responsibilities
- Caution against trend sustainability
- Could lead to constitutional imbalance

*Defense of Expanded Role:*
- Despite criticisms, clear judiciary's foray driven by
- Commitment to justice and upholding constitutional values
- Especially areas affecting public welfare and fundamental rights
- Approach ensured legal recourse
- Where legislative or executive action lacking
- Debate over separation of powers and judicial overreach continues
- Reflecting complex dynamics between branches
- In vibrant democracy like India

**Conclusion:**
Judiciary's acquisition of legislative and executive roles reflects proactive response to governance voids; through mechanisms like PIL and expansive interpretation, Court has filled critical gaps in protecting public welfare and constitutional rights; while this expansion demonstrates judicial commitment to justice, it necessitates ongoing dialogue about maintaining separation of powers while ensuring accountability—challenge lies in judiciary complementing rather than supplanting democratic governance branches.

*"The judiciary's legislative-executive dual role is democratic necessity meeting institutional vacuum—when Parliament delays sexual harassment law for decades, Vishaka Guidelines fill the void; when bureaucracy fails environmental protection, MC Mehta directives clear the air. Yet this judicial entrepreneurship is democracy's aspirin, not its vitamin: effective for immediate relief but unsustainable as permanent diet. India needs courts that inspire legislative action, not replace it, ensuring judicial activism remains exception, not governance norm."*

## Q.22) The role of president of India becomes more significant during the minority government and the coalition government. Explain. (2021) (15)

### 🎯 Core Theme
President's largely ceremonial role (Westminster model) gains critical significance during minority/coalition governments—discretionary powers in government formation (inviting leader commanding majority per Subhash C. Kashyap), crisis resolution (dissolution or alternative government formation), and constitutional propriety maintenance; scholars (Rajeev Dhavan, Granville Austin, Niraja Gopal Jayal) emphasize political sagacity and impartiality requirements; 1996 elections illustrated pivotal role navigating political impasse.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
President's Role | Ceremonial | Westminster Model | Minority Government | Coalition Government | Discretionary Powers | Article 75 | Subhash C. Kashyap | Government Formation | Rajeev Dhavan | Granville Austin | Lok Sabha Majority | Confidence Crisis | 1996 Elections | Niraja Gopal Jayal | Constitutional Morality | Political Sagacity | Coalition Partners

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Constitution envisages President's role as largely ceremonial

- No single party has clear Lok Sabha majority
- President's role inviting leader most likely to command majority becomes crucial
- Subhash C. Kashyap emphasized: President's discretion guided by constitutional conventions
- Overarching principle: Ensuring stable government
- Enjoying Parliament's confidence

*Coalition Government Dynamics:*
- Become norm in Indian politics since late 1980s
- President's role similarly enhanced
- Discretion in appointing PM particularly significant
- When no pre-election alliance has clear majority
- Or ambiguity about who commands majority support
- Within post-election coalition
- Political sagacity and impartiality critical in decision-making
- Rajeev Dhavan and Granville Austin: Discuss nuances of discretion
- In context of India's parliamentary democracy

*Crisis Management Role:*
- Vital in functioning of coalition governments
- Often prone to internal conflicts and instability
- When government faces confidence crisis within Parliament
- Decision to dissolve Lok Sabha and call fresh elections
- Or invite another leader to form government
- Rests with President
- Notably seen in 1996 general elections
- President's role in navigating political impasse pivotal

*Constitutional Guardianship:*
- Ensuring Council of Ministers acts per Constitution
- Even more significant in coalition politics context
- Where compromises and agreements between partners
- Could potentially conflict with constitutional provisions
- Niraja Gopal Jayal: Importance of President's oath
- To preserve, protect, defend Constitution
- Acting as guardian of constitutional morality

**Conclusion:**
President's role assumes greater importance and scrutiny during minority and coalition governments; discretionary powers in government formation, crisis resolution, upholding constitutional propriety become crucial ensuring political stability and constitutional governance; complexity underscores need for President who is not only constitutionally knowledgeable but also politically astute and impartial.

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"The President in coalition era is constitutional democracy's emergency brake—rarely touched in smooth single-party rule, frequently engaged when political arithmetic produces no clear mandate. From inviting the 'most likely' PM to dissolving fractured Parliaments, the President's discretion shapes governments without governing. This delicate power demands Presidents who are constitutional scholars, political sages, and impartial arbiters—proving that ceremonial offices carry the heaviest burdens when democracy's machinery jams."*

- However, in constitutional crisis situations
- Governor's role transforms significantly
- Becoming more central and decisive

**Body:**

*Article 356 - President's Rule:*
- Pivotal in understanding Governor's expanded role during crisis
- Allows Governor to recommend to President
- That state government cannot be carried on
- In accordance with Constitution provisions
- Effectively leading to state government dismissal
- Assumption of direct administration by center
- Governor's subjective judgment plays crucial role
- Making position powerful and potentially controversial

*Historical Context and Misuse:*
- Granville Austin commented on Article 356 use
- Tool necessary for maintaining federal structure and constitutional order
- Often misused for political ends
- Notorious dismissal of Kerala state government (1959)
- Several instances during 1970s and 1980s
- Often cited in political discourses
- Highlight how Governors can exercise significant executive powers
- Influencing political trajectory of states

*Sarkaria Commission Recommendations (1983):*
- Established to examine relationship and balance of power
- Between state and central governments
- Recommended: Article 356 power used very sparingly
- In extreme cases as last resort
- When all available options failed
- To prevent or rectify governance breakdown in state
- Commission aimed to limit arbitrary use
- Emphasized maintaining federalism and democracy spirit

*S.R. Bommai Judgment (1994):*
- Supreme Court landmark judgment
- Reinforced need for judicious Article 356 application
- President's power to dissolve state legislature subject to judicial review
- Curtailed Governor's discretionary power
- Insisting on more transparent and accountable approach
- In determining what constitutes constitutional machinery breakdown

**Conclusion:**
While Governor typically holds largely ceremonial role, position can assume significant executive powers during constitutional crisis; transformation underscores delicate balance between central oversight and state autonomy—fundamental aspect of India's federal structure; discussions and rulings reflect ongoing effort to refine and define high office limits and responsibilities; prevent misuse while ensuring governance and constitutional adherence during crises.

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"The Governor's constitutional crisis powers are federalism's nuclear option—necessary for extreme emergencies yet catastrophic if casually deployed. From Kerala's 1959 dismissal to S.R. Bommai's 1994 judicial leash, India learned that Article 356 must be democracy's last resort, not the Centre's first convenience. The Governor's transformation from ceremonial figurehead to powerful executive should occur so rarely that each instance merits constitutional history's footnote, ensuring that state autonomy bends only when genuinely broken."*

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Judicial activism is social change's impatient engine—when Parliament debates endlessly, courts deliver Vishaka; when bureaucracy pollutes, MC Mehta clears the air; when legislators fear backlash, Navtej Johar frees love. Yet Austin's 'Constitutional Revolution' and Hirschl's 'juristocracy' warning remind us: courts must be catalysts, not commanders of change, ensuring that judicial activism writes justice's first draft while democracy's elected branches author the final text."*
