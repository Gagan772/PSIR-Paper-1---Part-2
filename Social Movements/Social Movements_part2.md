## Q12. Critically examine Green Revolution as a strategy for sustainable agriculture development. (2012) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
The Green Revolution (1960s) dramatically boosted food production through HYV seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation, achieving food security—but its long-term sustainability is questionable due to environmental degradation, resource depletion, loss of biodiversity, and increased social inequities among farmers.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`1960s` | `High-Yielding Variety (HYV) Seeds` | `Chemical Fertilizers` | `Irrigation` | `Food Self-Sufficiency` | `Monoculture` | `Soil Degradation` | `Groundwater Depletion` | `Punjab-Haryana Water Crisis` | `Income Disparities` | `Biodiversity Loss`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Initiated in 1960s, transformative period in agriculture
- Aimed to increase food production in developing countries like India
- Introduction of HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, irrigation
- Significantly boosted output and alleviated famine
- Long-term sustainability and impacts subject of intense debate

**Body:**

*ACHIEVEMENTS (Positive Impacts):*

*1. Dramatic Increase in Crop Yields:*
- Primary achievement: dramatic increase in wheat and rice yields
- India achieved substantial increase in food grain production
- Self-sufficiency in food grains achieved
- Reduced dependence on food imports
- Michael Lipton: "Transformed India from starving nation to leading agricultural nation"

*2. Economic Impacts:*
- Contributed to rural prosperity where technologies implemented
- World Bank: Instrumental in reducing poverty levels in rural India (1970s-80s)
- Farmers adopting new technologies saw substantial income increases
- Higher crop yields meant higher incomes

*DRAWBACKS (Negative Impacts):*

*3. Environmental Degradation:*
- Intensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides
- Led to soil degradation and reduced fertility
- Pollution and pest resistance development
- Vandana Shiva: Critic of biodiversity impact
- Monoculture led to loss of agricultural biodiversity
- Food systems more vulnerable to pests, diseases, climate change

*4. Water-Related Issues:*
- Heavy reliance on irrigation
- Led to groundwater depletion
- Punjab and Haryana (Green Revolution frontrunners) now face severe water crises
- Over-extraction of groundwater
- Raises questions about long-term viability

*5. Social Inequities:*
- Benefits not uniformly distributed
- Wealthier and large-scale farmers more likely to afford new technologies
- Led to increased economic disparities
- Smallholder and marginal farmers often excluded
- High costs of HYV seeds, fertilizers, irrigation needs
- T.W. Schultz: Green Revolution widened income gaps between rich and poor farmers

**Conclusion:**
- Crucial role in enhancing food security short-term
- Long-term sustainability questionable
- Environmental degradation, resource depletion, social inequities
- Future strategies must integrate sustainable farming practices
- Promote ecological balance and social equity
