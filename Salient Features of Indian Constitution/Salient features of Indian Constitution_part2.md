The basic structure doctrine, articulated in Kesavananda Bharati (1973), establishes that while Parliament has wide amendment powers under Article 368, it cannot alter Constitution's basic features (supremacy, rule of law, separation of powers, Preamble objectives, judicial review, federalism)—safeguarding democratic values.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
Basic Structure Doctrine | Kesavananda Bharati 1973 | Article 368 | Parliamentary Amendment Powers | Supremacy of Constitution | Rule of Law | Separation of Powers | Preamble Objectives | Judicial Review | Federalism | Granville Austin | Upendra Baxi | Minerva Mills 1980

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Judicial principle: Constitution has certain basic features
- Cannot be altered/destroyed through parliamentary amendments
- First articulated in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)
- Response to extensive constitutional changes during Indira Gandhi's administration (early 1970s)
- Aimed to ensure essential features remain inviolable

**Body:**

*Kesavananda Bharati Ruling:*
- Supreme Court ruled: Parliament has wide powers under Article 368
- BUT cannot alter basic structure or framework
- Pivotal judgment placing limitation on Parliament's amendatory powers
- Previously thought to be unlimited
- Ensures fundamental identity remains preserved against potential misuse

*Features of Basic Structure:*
- Not explicitly defined in Constitution itself
- Supreme Court clarified through various rulings over time
- Identified features: Supremacy of Constitution, Rule of law, Separation of powers
- Preamble objectives (justice, liberty, equality, fraternity)

*Scholarly Reception:*
- Granville Austin: "Most important constitutional case in Indian history"
- "Providing pledge for India's democratic government"

- Over democratically elected legislature
- Potentially leading to judicial overreach

*Subsequent Applications:*
