### ✨ Power Conclusion
"Panchayati Raj Institutions embody a profound democratic truth—that imperfect institutions with limited resources can still transform governance when they genuinely empower people; despite financial constraints, despite inadequate devolution, despite capacity gaps, PRIs have brought millions of marginalized Indians into the political process, made governance accountable at the village level, and proven that democratic decentralization is not measured by the perfection of institutions but by the participation of people they enable."
