## Q2. Indian Party System: Federal Structure, Electoral System & Social Cleavages (2021, 20 Marks)

**Question:** "The Indian party system is shaped by a complex interaction of the country's federal structure, electoral system and social cleavages." Explain.

### 🎯 Core Theme
India's multiparty system emerges from the interplay of three factors: federal structure encouraging regional parties, the FPTP electoral system allowing fragmentation despite favoring larger parties, and deep social cleavages (caste, religion, language) enabling identity-based political mobilization and party proliferation.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
Federal Structure | FPTP Electoral System | Social Cleavages | Yogendra Yadav | Second Democratic Upsurge | Shiromani Akali Dal | Shiv Sena | BSP | SP | Kanchan Chandra | Ethnic Parties | Coalition Politics

**2. Electoral System and Its Impact**

- Plurality of votes → majority of seats
- BUT in India: allows smaller regional parties
- Parties secure seats by concentrating support
- Highly fragmented party system at state level
- Necessity of coalition governments at center
- No single party often secures absolute majority
- Examples: AAP in Delhi, AITC in West Bengal
- Electoral system empowers regionally focused parties

**3. Social Cleavages and Political Mobilization**
- Deep-seated cleavages: caste, religion, language, ethnicity
- Critical factor shaping party system
- Parties mobilize by appealing to identities

- BSP: primarily represents Dalit community
- SP: represents OBC interests in UP
- Reflects representational diversity
- Underscores challenges of managing divisions
- Kanchan Chandra: strategic use of identity politics
- Can empower marginalized AND exacerbate divisions

**4. Interplay of Three Factors**
- Federal structure allows regional autonomy
- Electoral system permits fragmented representation
- Social cleavages provide mobilization base
- Together create multiparty system
- Regional diversity becomes political reality
- Coalition politics becomes norm

#### Conclusion

**Question:** In the post liberalisation era, Indian politics is moving from ascriptive politics to developmental politics. Comment.

### 🎯 Core Theme

### 🎯 Core Theme
The assertion that development has overshadowed caste in electoral behavior remains contested—while Modi's cross-caste appeal and development campaigns suggest a shift toward "post-caste politics" (Yadav), scholars like Jaffrelot argue caste remains potent, leading to a symbiotic relationship where "developmental casteism" emerges, blending identity with governance demands.
