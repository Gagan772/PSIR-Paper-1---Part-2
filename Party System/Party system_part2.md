## Q12. Electoral Behaviour: Social & Economic Factors vs Political Factors (2022, 20 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Electoral behaviour in India is predominantly shaped by social identities (caste, religion, region) and economic considerations (welfare schemes, development promises) rather than ideological or purely political factors, reflecting the complex interplay of ascriptive identities and material interests.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`Vote Bank Politics` | `Caste Identity` | `Economic Voting` | `MGNREGA` | `PM-KISAN` | `BSP-Dalit Consolidation` | `Regional Pride` | `Welfare State`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Electoral behaviour influenced significantly by social and economic factors, often more than traditional political factors
- Scholars like **Yogendra Yadav** have extensively studied these dynamics
- India's diversity embeds social hierarchies deeply within voting patterns

**Body:**

*A. Social Factors - Caste and Religion:*
- **Yogendra Yadav's analysis:** Caste and religion are crucial determinants of voting behaviour
- Political parties mobilize voters based on these identities
- Example: **BSP** consolidating Dalit votes; caste identity more potent than party ideology
- Religious polarization influences electoral outcomes (2019 elections)

*B. Economic Factors - Vote Bank Politics:*
- **Pranab Bardhan's theory:** Economic policies tailored to specific socio-economic groups
- Welfare schemes as electoral tools:
  - MGNREGA (rural employment)
  - PM Kisan Samman Nidhi (direct cash transfers)
  - Free ration schemes
- Economic incentives can sway voter preferences independent of party ideology

*C. Regional and Identity Factors:*
- **Christophe Jaffrelot:** Regional parties champion regional, economic, and social causes
- Examples:
  - AITC in West Bengal (regional pride + welfare)
  - DMK in Tamil Nadu (language + cultural identity)
- Voter preference driven by regional and economic considerations over national narratives

*D. Recent Electoral Trends:*
- **2019 General Elections:** BJP leveraged nationalist sentiments + economic development agenda
- Blend of social identity politics with economic promises
- Economic factors inseparable from social identities in influencing voter behaviour

*E. Counter-Arguments - Political Factors:*
- Leadership charisma (Modi factor)
- National security issues (Balakot strikes)
- Ideological positioning (Hindutva, secularism)
- Yet these often intersect with social/economic dimensions

**Conclusion:**
- Social and economic factors predominate over purely political factors
- Caste, religion, economic status, and regional identity are critical determinants
- This reflects the multifaceted nature of democracy in a diverse India
