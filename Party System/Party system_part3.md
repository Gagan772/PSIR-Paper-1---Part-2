## Q24. Federal Structure, Electoral System & Social Cleavages (2021, 20 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
India's party system is uniquely shaped by the interplay of three forces: the federal structure enabling regional parties to flourish, the FPTP electoral system creating incentives for coalition politics, and social cleavages (caste, religion, language) giving rise to identity-based political mobilization.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`FPTP System` | `Regional Parties` | `Social Cleavages` | `Caste Mobilization` | `BSP-SP` | `Coalition Dynamics` | `Kanchan Chandra` | `E. Sridharan`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Indian party system characterized by multiplicity and diversity
- Product of complex interplay among three factors:
  - Federal structure
  - Electoral system
  - Social cleavages

**Body:**

*A. Federal Structure and Party System:*
- Designed to accommodate geographical, linguistic, cultural diversity
- Encourages growth of regional parties for state-level interests
- **E. Sridharan:** Federalism enables regional parties to flourish by providing substantial governance role
- **Examples:**
  - DMK (Tamil Nadu)—Dravidian identity
  - Shiv Sena (Maharashtra)—Marathi regionalism
  - Multi-tiered party system

*B. Electoral System (FPTP) Impact:*
- First-Past-The-Post model characteristics:
  - Translates plurality into majority
  - Can exaggerate strength of larger parties
  - Under-represents smaller parties nationally
- **Yogendra Yadav:** FPTP creates disincentive for small national parties but encourages state-level parties
- Encourages strategic alliances and coalition politics
- Pre-election and post-election coalitions increasingly prominent

*C. Social Cleavages and Political Mobilization:*
- Cleavages based on caste, religion, ethnicity, language
- Politicization leads to parties representing specific social groups
- **Kanchan Chandra:** Caste and religion mobilized to construct vote banks
- **Examples:**
  - BSP: Represents Dalit community
  - SP: Following among OBCs and Muslims in UP
- Segmentation reflects deep-seated social hierarchies

*D. Interaction of Three Factors:*
- Creates highly competitive and fluid party system
- Frequent party splits, defections, new political entities
- **Suhas Palshikar:** Fluidity and coalitional politics as hallmark
- Constant negotiation and accommodation among diverse actors

*E. Constitutional Framework:*
- Seventh Schedule: Division of powers (Union, State, Concurrent)
- Linguistic reorganization of states (1950s-60s)
- Reservation provisions for SCs, STs, OBCs

**Conclusion:**
- Party system is product of complex interaction of federal dynamics, electoral mechanisms, social divisions
- Shapes nature of political competition and party strategies
- Reflects underlying social fabric of Indian society
- Understanding this relationship crucial for analyzing democratic challenges and opportunities
